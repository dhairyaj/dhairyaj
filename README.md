### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dhairya Jain, a Software Engineer at Volante Technologies. I love to talk about technology and more than that find ways for incorporating them in daily life.   
I love to create business ideas and strategies. Though I haven't yet started a business or startup of my own, I aspire to start one.   
Interested in web development and open source technologies, I love how websites look and work. They just light me up.   

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web Development frameworks like React.js, Node.js and then completing the MERN stack.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the following projects:  
- <a href="https://github.com/cimplec/sim-c">simC</a> licensed under GPL v3
- Project DC (Private repo as of now :grimacing:, will soon be open sourced :wink:)
- <a href="https://github.com/lang-pulse/Pulse">Pulse</a> yet to be open sourced
- Documentive, a project for making resumes and research papers using latex (yet to be open sourced :wink:)
- and a bunch of other personal web related projects( mostly part of self learning the technologies ðŸ˜„)

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with people who are enthusiastic about Web Development, Artificial Intelligence and related areas. Have some really cool and exciting projects you want to be part of.
